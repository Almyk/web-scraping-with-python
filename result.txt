Hurricane Carmen was the most intense tropical cyclone of the 1974 Atlantic hurricane season. A destructive and widespread storm, Carmen originated as a tropical disturbance that traveled westward from Africa, spawning a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles on August 29. Moving through the Caribbean Sea, it quickly strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, and made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula. It turned north into the Gulf of Mexico, re-intensified, and made a second landfall in the marshland of southern Louisiana, dissipating over eastern Texas on September 10. Tropical cyclone watches and warnings had been issued for the storm, and around 100,000 residents left their homes and sought shelter. Damage was lighter than first feared, but the sugar industry suffered substantial losses. The hurricane killed 8 people and caused damage valued at $162 million. The name Carmen was retired from the list of Atlantic tropical cyclone names in 1975. (Full article...)

Wikipedia:Protection policy
Wikipedia is built around the principle that anyone can edit it, and it therefore aims to have as many of its pages as possible open for public editing so that anyone can add material and correct errors. However, in some particular circumstances, because of a specifically identified likelihood of damage resulting if editing is left open, some individual pages may need to be subject to technical restrictions (often only temporary but sometimes indefinitely) on who is permitted to modify them. The placing of such restrictions on pages is called protection.

Wikipedia:Requests for page protection
This page is for requesting that a page, file or template be fully protected, create protected (salted), extended confirmed protected, semi-protected, added to pending changes, move-protected, template protected (template-specific), upload protected (file-specific), or unprotected. Please read up on the protection policy. Full protection is used to stop edit warring between multiple users or to prevent vandalism to high-risk templates; semi-protection and pending changes are usually used only to prevent IP and new user vandalism (see the rough guide to semi-protection); and move protection is used to stop pagemove revert wars. Extended confirmed protection is used where semi-protection has proved insufficient (see the rough guide to extended confirmed protection)
